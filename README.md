# ReligioDAO Dapp for Decentralized Content Management

## Overview

This project aims to develop a decentralized web application for the ReligioDAO community to manage and curate blog posts, primarily focused on describing rituals. The application leverages Swarm for decentralized content storage, the Q.org protocol for governance, and the EtherJot npm package for blog management, all integrated within a Svelte-based frontend.

## Features

- **Decentralized Content Storage**: Store blogs and governance documents on Swarm.
- **Community Governance**: Use the Q protocol for community-driven curation and governance of content.
- **Blog Management with EtherJot**: Simplify blog creation and management with pre-built templates and easy uploads.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Content Storage and Integration with Swarm
- Configure Swarm nodes for content hosting.
- Develop interfaces for content upload, retrieval, and decentralized hosting using Svelte.
- Integrate content hosting for the Light Paper and blog articles.

### Milestone 2: Governance Framework Development
- Develop a decentralized application (DApp) for governance integrated with Q.org's blockchain.
- Create a user-friendly interface for DAO members to interact with the governance system.
- Implement smart contracts for proposal submissions, voting, and approval processes.

### Milestone 3: Etherjot Integration for Blogging
- Integrate EtherJot into the Svelte-based frontend.
- Enable a community-driven blog platform with templates for easy content creation.
- Incorporate the Q voting system for article curation and approval.

### Milestone 4: Community Engagement and Content Generation
- Launch campaigns to educate and inform about the new content management system.
- Provide incentives for community content contributions.
- Develop tutorials and resources for using Swarm and the DApp.

## Technical Requirements

- **Front-End**: Svelte, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask (or similar)
- **Blockchain Libraries**: Web3.js / Ethers.js
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Q Protocol
- **Decentralized Storage**: Swarm
- **Optional Backend**: Node.js (for additional off-chain operations)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    REACT_APP_SWARM_GATEWAY_URL=https://swarm-gateway-url
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### Usage
